# PartsHouse
Partshouse is a MERN stack web application using a REST API and Redux.
It is designed to keep track of valuable assets in your home and allows you to send yourself notifications and purchase links when an item needs to be re-purchased,. Partshouse is the place to keep information regarding home appliances, pc components, car parts etc...  so you're no longer shuffeling through that miscellanious drawer we all know you have.

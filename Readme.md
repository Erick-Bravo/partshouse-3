# PartsHouse
Partshouse is a REST API AND MERN stack web application using REACT.js and Redux Toolkit.
It is designed to keep track of valuable assets in your home and allows you to schedule notifications to re-purchase items with a previously saved link. Partshouse is the place to keep information regarding home appliances, pc components, car parts etc...  so you're no longer shuffeling through that miscellanious drawer we all know you have.
